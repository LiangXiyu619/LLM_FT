The user provided a query in Japanese: \"くくり罠 バネなし\" which translates to \"trap without spring\" or \"springless trap\". The product in question is titled \"穴を掘らないくくり罠 NH-20TypeC\" and has a description that mentions it's an improved version of the NH-30 model. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the product matches the query exactly. The query is about a springless trap. Looking at the product title and description, the product is a \"springless trap\" as it's a modified version of the NH-30, which presumably has a spring. However, the product description mentions \"押しバネ\" (push spring) in the bullet points, like \"押しバネは18mm径×1200mm 線形2mm 圧縮力20kgの強力型\" (push spring with specific dimensions and compression force). Wait, that seems contradictory. If the product has a push spring, then it's not springless. But the query is for a springless trap. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The product title is \"穴を掘"}
